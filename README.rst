Pygame_sdl2
===========

Pygame_sdl2 is a reimplementation of the Pygame API using SDL2 and
related libraries. The initial goal of this project are to allow
games written using the pygame API to run on SDL2 on desktop and
mobile  platforms. We will then evolve the API to expose SDL2-provided
functionality in a pythonic manner.

License
-------

New code written for pygame_sdl2 is licensed under the Zlib license. Some
code - including compiled code - is taken wholesale from Pygame, and is
licensed under the LGPL2. Please check each module to
determine its licensing status.

See the COPYING.ZLIB and COPYING.LGPL21 files for details - you'll need
to comply with both to distribute software containing pygame_sdl2.

Current Status
--------------

Pygame_sdl2 builds and runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, with a useful
subset of the pygame API working. The following modules have at least
some implementation:

* pygame_sdl2.color
* pygame_sdl2.display
* pygame_sdl2.draw
* pygame_sdl2.event
* pygame_sdl2.font
* pygame_sdl2.gfxdraw
* pygame_sdl2.image
* pygame_sdl2.joystick
* pygame_sdl2.key
* pygame_sdl2.locals
* pygame_sdl2.mixer (including mixer.music)
* pygame_sdl2.mouse
* pygame_sdl2.scrap
* pygame_sdl2.sprite
* pygame_sdl2.surface
* pygame_sdl2.sysfont
* pygame_sdl2.time
* pygame_sdl2.transform
* pygame_sdl2.version

Experimental new modules include:

* pygame_sdl2.render

Current omissions include:

* Modules not listed above.

* APIs that expose pygame data as buffers or arrays.

* Support for non-32-bit surface depths. Our thinking is that 8, 16,
  and (to some extent) 24-bit surfaces are legacy formats, and not worth
  duplicating code four or more times to support. This only applies to
  in-memory formats - when an image of lesser color depth is loaded, it
  is converted to a 32-bit image.

* Support for palette functions, which only apply to 8-bit surfaces.

Documentation
-------------

There isn't much pygame_sdl2 documentation at the moment, especially for
end-users. Check out the pygame documentation at:

    http://www.pygame.org/docs/

There is one new api we should mention. Running the code::

    import pygame_sdl2
    pygame_sdl2.import_as_pygame()

Will modify sys.modules so that pygame_sdl2 modules are used instead of
their pygame equivalents. For example, after running the code above,
the code::

    import pygame.image
    img = pygame.image.load("logo.png")

will use pygame_sdl2 to load the image, instead of pygame. (This is intended
to allow code to run on pygame_sdl2 or pygame.)

Building
--------

Building pygame_sdl2 requires the ability to build python modules; the
ability to link against the SDL2, SDL2_gfx, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer,
and SDL2_ttf libraries; and the ability to compile cython code.

To build pygame_sdl2 on Ubuntu, install the build dependencies using the
command::

    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev \
        libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev virtualenvwrapper

Open a new shell to ensure virtualenvwrapper is running, then run::

    mkvirtualenv pygame_sdl2
    pip install cython

Change into a clone of this project, and run the following command to modify
the virtualenv so pygame_sdl2 header files can be installed in it::

    python fix_virtualenv.py

Finally, build and install pygame_sdl2 by running::

    python setup.py install

Contributing
------------

We're looking for people to contribute to pygame_sdl2 development. For
simple changes, just give us a pull request. Before making a change that
is a lot of work, it might make sense to send us an email to ensure we're
not already working on it.
